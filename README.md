# Environmental_disaster_prediction
this project uses machine learning to predict potential environmental disasters based on key indicators such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and other relevant features. It aims to provide early warnings and insights to help mitigate the impact of natural disasters like floods, wildfires, and storms.
Environmental Disaster Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict potential environmental disasters based on key indicators such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and other relevant features. It aims to provide early warnings and insights to help mitigate the impact of natural disasters like floods, wildfires, and storms.

🔍 Problem Statement
Environmental disasters cause significant damage to life, property, and ecosystems. Early prediction using data-driven models can enable proactive disaster management and planning.

This project builds a predictive model trained on historical environmental data to forecast the likelihood of disaster events.

🧠 Model
The core of the system is a machine learning model (model.pkl) trained using supervised learning techniques. The model takes in multiple environmental parameters as input and predicts the probability or category of a disaster.

🖥️ Frontend
A user-friendly interface is built using Streamlit for real-time predictions. Users can input environmental readings and receive immediate predictions from the model.

📦 Requirements
Python 3.x

Streamlit

Scikit-learn

NumPy

Pandas

(Optional) Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization
